### 13h00 - 13h50 -- Vincent Deman (Univ Paris Saclay)

**Mechanistic insights into vaccine-induced innate immune responses from integrating prior knowledge and experimental data with Boolean models**

Researchers have studied complex biological systems for
   decades, developing models to understand and modulate their dynamics. The
   Boolean modeling formalism simplifies these systems by focusing on their
   qualitative changes. We designed a computational methodology to build and
   analyze Boolean networks based on a combination of existing knowledge and
   experimental data. We applied it to Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)
   vaccine-induced responses and obtained a network
   that closely matched experimental observations, including in unseen
   perturbed conditions, thereby asserting the legitimacy of our approach. By
   comparing the Boolean networks of the MVA-induced versus the vaccination
   gold standard YF17D-induced responses, we identified targets for improving
   the MVA’s immunogenicity. Our methodology demonstrates the applicability
   and usefulness of the Boolean formalism for systems vaccinology, addressing
   the underlying biological complexity despite limited sample sizes and
   diverse data.
