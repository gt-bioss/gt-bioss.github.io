### 13h00 - 13h50 -- Rémi Segretain (TIMC-IMAG, Grenoble)

**Obtaining uniqueness and completeness within sets of Sign Boolean Networks is difficult**

Boolean Networks are sets of Boolean functions connected according to a particular arrangement. If one want to get every possible networks of a given dimension, it is insufficient to simply enumerate every combination of functions and arrangements. A lot of duplicates or even invalid networks will be listed. How to be sure that a generated network should be kept or not ?
Moreover, when using a subclass of Boolean Functions like the Sign Boolean Functions in our case, from where do you get the set of functions out of which the networks will be build ? How to guarantee that this set is complete and only contains unique functions?
Finally, how much computing time and memory is needed to handle all those constraints ? For how long do the resource requirements stay viable if one aim for larger and larger dimension ?
This presentation will detail these problems and the solutions we have explored and used to address them.
