**Interconnection of biological oscillators with asynchronous Boolean networks: application to a model of mammalian circadian clock network**

Asynchronous Boolean network are a powerful tool to analyze qualitatively the dynamics of complex cellular regulatory networks. In particular, they provide an efficient framework to explore the dynamics of interconnected networks from the dynamics of isolated modules. In this talk we propose and analyze a Boolean model of mammalian circadian clock genes network. This model exhibits a single complex attractor, containing hundreds of states. With a dedicated method, we construct a “summary graph” of the attractor in order to compare it with biological knowledge. This summary graph confirms the model actually captures the main sequence of circadian phases, as expected from the literature. The combination of the two techniques (summary graph and network interconnections) offers the possibility to tackle difficult biological questions, about the crosstalk or the synchronization between complex biological oscillators.
