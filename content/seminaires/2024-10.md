### 13h00 - 13h50 -- Loïc Paulevé (CNRS/LaBRI)

**Phenotype control and elimination of variables in Boolean networks**

Joint work with Elisa Tonello (Freie Univ Berlin)

We investigate how elimination of variables can affect the asymptotic dynamics and phenotype control of Boolean networks. In particular, we look at the impact on minimal trap spaces, and identify a structural condition that guarantees their preservation. We examine the possible effects of variable elimination under three of the most popular approaches to control (attractor-based control, value propagation and control of minimal trap spaces), and under different update schemes (synchronous, asynchronous, generalized asynchronous). We provide some insights on the application of reduction, and an ample inventory of examples and counterexamples.
