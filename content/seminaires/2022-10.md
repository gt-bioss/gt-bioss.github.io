### 13h00 - 13h50 -- Grégory Batt (InBio team, Inria and Institut Pasteur)

**Experimental and computational methods for synthetic biology and cybergenetics**

Synthetic biology aims at genetically engineering cells to solve problems of biomedical or industrial interests, and cybergenetics aims at controlling natural or artificial biological processes using genetically-engineered cellular systems and automatic control. In both fields, quantitative modeling is expected to play a central role. Yet despite intense research in these fields, the gap between theory and practice remains large, and the predictive power of the models remains modest.\
At InBio, we are trying to bridge this gap through the joint development of experimental and computational methods. In this talk, I will present in the first part some of our recent works on the construction of automated experimental platforms to generate quality data obtained in well-controlled conditions. In the second part, I will present applications of modeling approaches that capture cellular heterogeneity to obtain quantitatively predictive models for natural and synthetic biological systems. I will conclude the presentation with perspectives on design, build, test, and learn approaches for the rational construction of synthetic biological systems.
