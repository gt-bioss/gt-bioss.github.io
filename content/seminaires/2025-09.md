**Path Constraints Improve Change Predictions for Partial Reaction Networks**

Abstract: We reconsider algorithms predicting changes of reaction networks with partial kinetic information in steady state. These prediction algorithms are based on logical reasoning with the abstract interpretation of steady state equations over the finite domain of changes increase, decrease, and no-change). We show how to improve the predictions in precision based on path constraints that can be inferred from the graph of the  reaction network. We show the addition of path constraints can strongly improve the precision of the change predictions. This is illustrated at the application to gene knockout prediction for metabolic control networks of Bacillus subtilis
