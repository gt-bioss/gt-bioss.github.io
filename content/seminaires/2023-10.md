### 13h00 - 13h50 -- Angélique Stéphanou (Laboratoire TIMC-IMAG, DyCTiM Team, Grenoble)

**Spatial multi-scale model of tumor metabolism**

In this work, a model of tumor metabolism highlighting the spatiotemporal heterogeneity is developed. This model makes it possible to test different scenarios of environmental stress and to assess their consequences on the metabolic trajectory of individual cells as well as of the tissue as a whole. Moreover, by combining continuous and discrete approaches within a hybrid multiscale model, cell metabolism is spatially contextualized and complex behaviors emerge.
